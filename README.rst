===========
gh-watch.py
===========

I use this script to find projects on GitHub.

It can find through three sources:

* GitHub search,
* `GitHub Trends RSS`_, and
* `r/coolgithubprojects`_.

.. _GitHub Trends RSS: http://github-trends.ryotarai.info/
.. _r/coolgithubprojects: https://www.reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects/

I don't expect anyone would use it, so if you think about trying this, either
read the code or nudge me.
